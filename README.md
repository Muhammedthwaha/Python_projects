# 🐍📊 Python Projects – Data Analytics & Data Science

This repository contains my **Python-based data analytics and data science projects**.  
Each folder is a separate project focused on topics such as:

- 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- 🧹 Data cleaning and preprocessing
- 📈 Visualization and dashboards
- 🤖 Machine learning models
- 📊 Statistical analysis and experimentation

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Muhammedthwaha/python-projects.git
   cd python-projects
   ```
2. Open any project folder to see:
   - 📓 Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) or Python scripts (`.py`)
   - 🗂️ Dataset info or links
   - 🧠 Brief explanation of the analysis or model

Feel free to explore, learn from the code, and adapt these projects for your own data problems. 💡
