# Python Projects – Data Analytics & Data Science 🤖

This repository contains my **Python-based data analytics and data science projects**.  
Each folder is a separate project focused on topics such as:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Visualization and dashboards
- Machine learning models
- Statistical analysis and experimentation

## How to Use

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Muhammedthwaha/python-projects.git
   cd python-projects
   ```
2. Open any project folder to see:
   - Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) or Python scripts (`.py`)
   - Dataset info or links
   - Brief explanation of the analysis or model

Feel free to explore, learn from the code, and adapt these projects for your own data problems.
